# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# Examples: /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
#
##### Mohin's notes: #####
# Original WSL2 bashrc file moved to ~/dotfiles git folder and renamed to
# bashrc_WSL2. Put this file in user's root folder and source the WSL bash file
# to enable git maintenance

source ~/dotfiles/bashrc_WSL2
